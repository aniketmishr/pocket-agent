## What is Pocket Agent?

Pocket Agent is your **personal AI assistant in your pocket** ‚Äì simple, accessible, and powerful. You can talk to it anytime, even from your mobile through Telegram. It can handle everything from simple queries to complex tasks, boring chores, and even multi-step workflows by connecting to your favorite tools.

Unlike niche agents built for very specific use cases, Pocket Agent is designed for **everyone**. Whether you want quick information, tool integration, or daily workflows, it‚Äôs here to make life easier (as it should be!).

## The Problem It Solves

Most AI agents today are either too complex for general users or limited in what they can do. Pocket Agent solves this by:

* Being **easy to use** via Telegram commands.
* Keeping **humans in control** with clarification before important actions.
* Seamlessly **connecting to multiple tools** with OAuth.
* Supporting **ready-to-use workflows** for everyday tasks.

---

## Technical Details ‚öôÔ∏è

Pocket Agent is built using:

* [telegram-python-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)
* [Portia Python SDK](https://github.com/portiaAI/portia-python-sdk)

### Core Concepts from Portia AI

1. **Spectrum of Autonomy**

   * Full autonomy agents using `portia.run`.
   * Built-in workflows using **PlanBuilderV2** with controllability.

2. **OAuth**

   * Secure connections to external tools like Google Docs, Notion, and more.

3. **Clarification**

   * Human-in-the-loop confirmation before executing important actions, ensuring agents remain controllable and safe.

## Telegram Commands üì±

* `/start` ‚Üí Start the Pocket Agent bot.
* `/help` ‚Üí List available commands.
* `/workflow` ‚Üí Run built-in workflows using Portia‚Äôs PlanBuilderV2.

### How it Works

* **Simple queries** ‚Üí handled by a lightweight LLM call.
* **Complex queries** ‚Üí handled by `portia.run`, which can plan and execute actions.
* **OAuth required?** ‚Üí The bot will send a friendly clarification request to connect your tool.
* **Important step?** ‚Üí The bot always asks for confirmation before taking action (human in the loop).

## My Learnings from this Hackathon üìö

Before this hackathon, I knew very little about AI agents. Now, I have a **solid understanding of how agents work**, and how to build them to solve not just my own problems but also those of friends and family.

I also learned:

* How to build Telegram bots.
* How to use `asyncio` (a bit confusing at first, but very powerful!).
* How to design agents that are **controllable, safe, and useful**.

## Future Work üöÄ

1. Add **streaming support** for faster responses.
2. Build **new workflows** for more everyday tasks.
3. Add **file support** (upload, process, summarize).
4. Scale to **multiple users** with better session handling.
5. Allow **workflow scheduling** for automation.
